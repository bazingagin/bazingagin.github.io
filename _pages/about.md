Hi, I'm Gin, a PhD student at University of Waterloo, supervised by [Professor Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). Before coming to Canada, I spent four years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and did research at Blender, supervised by [Professor Heng Ji](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/hengji).

On a high level, I'm mainly interested in understanding human learning and improving machine learning.
Generalization and interpretability are two topics that I'm mostly enthusiastic about. I deeply believe in the connection between compression and learning in general which draws my interest towards the information theoretic approaches.
Besides machine learning, I also love researching about food science and neuroscience.

In addition to research, I created an [online learning platform](https://www.warmmachine.org/) with my co-founder <a href="https://phinoda.github.io">@Phi</a>.
