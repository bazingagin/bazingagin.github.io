Hi, I'm Gin, a PhD candidate at University of Waterloo, supervised by [Professor Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). Before coming to Canada, I spent four years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and did research at Blender, supervised by [Professor Heng Ji](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/hengji).

On a high level, I'm mainly interested in understanding and improving machine learning.
My recent focus is on compositional generalization and interpretability.
