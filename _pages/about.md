Hi, I'm Gin, a (recent) PhD graduate from University of Waterloo. During the flash ~3.5 years at UWaterloo, I was lucky enough to be supervised by [Professor Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/) and to collaborate closely with [Professor Ming Li](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mli/). Before coming to Canada, I spent four years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and did research at Blender, supervised by [Professor Heng Ji](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/hengji). My research area focuses on interpretability and generalizability for machine learning.

On a high level, Iâ€™m mainly interested in understanding human learning and improving machine learning. My deep belief in the connection between compression and learning in general draws my interest towards the information theoretic approaches. Besides machine learning, I also love researching about food science and neuroscience.

In addition to research, I created [AFAIK.io](https://afaik.io), a map of human knowledge with <a href="https://twitter.com/YiqinDai">@Quinn</a>.
